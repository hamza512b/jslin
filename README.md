# LIN Programming language
![LIN  function for counting fibonacci ](./docs//syntax-highlight.png)
Programming language written in typescript, inspired by python and IT IS MOSTLY UPPERCASE! 


LIN is turning complete language, meaning you can write any program in it, but I am not sure why you would want to do that. Due not having standard library, or way to link files.

I written the language for fun, and to learn more about how programming languages work.

# LIN Programming language

Programming language written in typescript, inspired by python and IT IS MOSTLY UPPERCASE! 


LIN is turing complete language, meaning you can write any program in it, but I am not sure why you would want to do that.

I have written the language for fun, and to learn more about how programming languages work.


## How to run LIN
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`, to install the dependencies (ts-node).
3. Write your LIN code in the `./test.lin` file.
4. Run `npm run start`, to start the program.
